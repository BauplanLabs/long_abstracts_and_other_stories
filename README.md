* [DAG Lakehouse Planning with an Ephemeral and Embedded Graph Database](pdfs/kuzu_bauplan_lightining_2025.pdf), Luca Bigon, Jacopo Tagliabue, Semih SalihoÄŸlu. TL;DR: we present a
graph-based planning module that uses an embedded graph database to provide static checks and planning to a multi-language FaaS lakehouse.
* [The Deconstructed Warehouse: an Ephemeral Query Engine Design for Apache Iceberg](pdfs/duckdb_parser_lightining_2025.pdf), Ryan Curtin, Jacopo Tagliabue. TL;DR: we present a novel design for integrating data catalogs, open formats and single-node engines into a "deconstructed warehouse" running over a FaaS-based infrastructure. We motivate a new command for DuckDB, EXPLAIN SCANS, which sits in between the logical and the physical plan as an intermediate optimization.
